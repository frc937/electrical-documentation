# Build Season Schedule

This is a rough schedule of what build season should look like. It's gonna look fast, but that's just how FRC is. You won't believe how much you can get done working as many hours a week as you will.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**STICK TO THIS SCHEDULE**, no matter when competition is. Extra time beyond the 6 weeks should be used for driver/pit practice.
{% endhint %}
